    Internal API rate management for botocore library. Allows consumers
    to set a rate that API calls are made by all boto3.resource client types, configurable
    in milliseconds.

    So multi-threaded applications such as ScoutSuite can fix the period
    between API calls in order to avoid rate limiting by AWS. This period can
    be changed dynamically at run time in order for consumers to create utilities
    that respond in real time to being rate limited if appropriate.

    Using an incremental back-off strategy tends to exacerbate the problem of AWS rate limiting
    applications that hit the APIs at a high rate, as it continues to hit the APIs while backing off
    and so continues to cause issues until it reaches a rate that is acceptable.

    By allowing the consumer to set the rate at the application level, rather than the network level,
    it is possible for end users to set a rate that they know will not cause issues on their particular platform.
